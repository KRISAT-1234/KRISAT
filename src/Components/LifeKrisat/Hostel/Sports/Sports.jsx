        Cultural centers on college campuses significantly enhance student
        learning by fostering leadership development, community engagement,
        cultural identity, and a sense of belongingâ€”all vital components of the
        learning process. Recognizing this importance, KRISAT has established a
        cultural center that provides students with a platform for
        self-expression and personal growth.
        <br />
        <br /> A senior faculty member serves as the Staff Advisor, while a
        faculty member is appointed as the Assistant Staff Advisor by the
        Principal. The Staff Advisor plays a crucial role in organizing
        students' welfare and extra-curricular activities. Faculty members from
        various disciplines act as coordinators for both academic and
        non-academic student club activities, while the Physical Director
        oversees the sports curriculum.
        <br />
        <br />
        To ensure effective functioning, the Principal nominates student
        representatives (Secretary and Joint Secretary) for various clubs and
        sports each year, forming the executive council of the Student Club. The
        Club Secretary and Games Secretary manage the literary and sports
        activities, respectively, providing every student with opportunities to
        learn, express, and develop their talents in arts, literature, debate,
        drama, and sports through various club activities.
        <br />
        <br />
        To nurture students' innate talents, KRISAT organizes cultural events,
        including TALARC, a competition among fourth-year students featuring 18
        on-stage and 10 off-stage events. Winners receive prizes, celebrating
        their achievements. Another significant event is FIESTA, an inter-year
        competition that encompasses both on-stage and off-stage activities,
        culminating in awards for overall champions and individual titles such
        as Mr. FIESTA and Ms. FIESTA.
        <br />
        <br />
        The diverse cultural programs organized by the student club at KRISAT
        since 2016 reflect the vibrant community and the commitment to fostering
        talent among students. The list of these events is provided below.
